cdbi: Type-safe database programming
====================================

This package contains libraries to support type-safe database programming.
[This paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/JFLP04_dyn.html)
contains a description of the basic ideas behind these libraries.

Usually, it is not necessary to use these libraries directly.
Instead, one can use the Curry preprocessor to formulate
type-safe SQL queries which are translated into calls to these libraries.
